**Abstract**

Several recent major findings in the field of adult prostate stem cells have advanced our understanding of the cell biology. Earlier seminal studies in the murine prostate demonstrated and defined the cell biology and dynamics. However, it remained unclear how these findings correlated to the human prostate stem cell until very recently. The location and dynamics of the human adult prostate stem cell niche have now been identified. This has implications for further research into the origins of benign prostatic hypertrophy and prostate cancer. This review summarises the current evidence for prostate stem cells and their niche in both the murine and human models.
