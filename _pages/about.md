## Welcome to my Github page!

- I'm a 2nd year PhD student at the University of East Anglia, Norwich, United Kingdom

- My research interests are broadly in the field of cancer - specifically interested in projects related to early detection and prognostic analysis of cancers through various methods including epigenetic modifications, microbial involvement and more

- I am currently part of the Cancer Genetics Lab at UEA under Prof. Daniel Brewer and Prof. Colin Cooper

- I am a qualified clinician having done my Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS) from St. John's Medical College, Bangalore, India (2012-2018)

- I finished my Doctorate in Medicine (MD) in Translational and Clinical Research from Newcastle University, United Kingdom (2018-2022) working on the prostate stem cell niche and it's architecture.

- I am currently researching the effect of bacteria on aggressive prostate cancer and delving into the role of the prostate microbiome in the setting of cancer.

- Outside of science, I have a keen interest in sports - both watching and playing it. I also host a podcast in my mother tongue, Tamil, about Liverpool Football Club. I am also an avid reader and love reading books.
