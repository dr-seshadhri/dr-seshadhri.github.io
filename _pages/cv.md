# Post-Graduate Education

## Doctorate in Philosophy (PhD)
### University of East Anglia, United Kingdom (2022-Current)

- **Currently doing a PhD working on Bacterial involvement in aggressive prostate cancer as part of the Microbes, Microbiomes and Bioinformatics Doctoral Training Programme (MMB DTP) funded by the Medical Research Council (MRC)**
	1. **Working in the lab** designing and conducting experiments of the following nature:
		- **Library Preparation and 16S Sequencing using Illumina MiSeq** of Frozen urine samples and also to eventually work with freshly collected prostate secretion samples and home-collected urine samples
		- **Culturing bacteria and working with anaerobic cabinet conditions**
	2. **Working with bioinformatics** to investigate large prostate cancer datasets like the Pan Prostate Cancer Group Dataset (PPCG) and to analyse the results of sequencing
		- Project involves working with **shell scripting and R programming** to analyse microbiome data 
		- Created and running a successful **Snakemake pipeline** using the HUMAnN and Maaslin2 packages to analyse PPCG data and characterise the metabolic profiles of bacteria involved in prostate cancer

## Doctorate in Medicine (MD in Translational and Clinical Research)
### Newcastle University, United Kingdom (2018-2022)

- **Did a three-year lab project ending with a thesis entitled "Characterising the Architecture of the Stem Cell Niche in Benign Prostatic Tissue"
- It was a lab-based project in which I acquired the following skills
	1. Designing and conducting practical experiments using **immunohistochemistry-based techniques** such as the standard DAB-IHC, multiplex immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence as well as immunohistochemistry using specialised kits (Opal kit)
	2. Methodically learnt to problem solve during the design and conduct of those experiments
	3. I also trained in other lab techniques such as polymerase chain reaction experiments (PCR), cell culture and Western Blotting
	4. **Wrote a review paper entitled "Human Prostate Stem Cells and their Niche - A Comprehensive Review" (Subramanian, Geraghty et al., 2019) in the Journal of Stem Cell Research, Development and Therapy.**
	5. **Mentored three undergraduate students** during this period and was a secondary author in their poster presentations
	6. Researched, analysed and wrote a 20,000 word thesis on the topic as well. Delivered a presentation on the project and was able to successfully answer questions from both fellow students and academics.

	1. Conducted a **retrospective chart review study** at a primary health centre to assess outcome of antenatal care in areas serviced by the hospital and evaluate the need to improve healthcare during pregnancy
	2. Conducted a project with the Department of Pathology at St. John's Medical College to investigate the prevalence of Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase-1 receptors in lung cancer patints at a tertiary care hospital in South India.
	3. Learnt basic statistical analysis and application using SPSS software.
