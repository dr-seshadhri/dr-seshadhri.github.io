# About Me

## Childhood and Schooling

I was born on the 14th of December 1994 in Chennai - a lovely city in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu. Growing up however, I spent most of my young childhood in Mumbai - the commercial and business capital of the country. At the age of seven, I - along with my family - moved to live in Nairobi, Kenya where we stayed till I finished Year Seven. At the age of twelve, I returned back to India - this time finally settling in Chennai till I finished in high school. 

My interest in science was primarily due to my time in Kenya where some of my science teachers had a profound influence on me liking the subject. My specific liking for biology stemmed from that and was solidified by my thirteenth birthday, thanks to a documentary on heart transplants. I had decided by then that I was going to become a doctor. While I did well in physics and chemistry, I never appreciated them as sciences enough until much later in life.

I worked towards this aim through my high school and prepared extensively through my last two years of schooling for the ultra-competitive entrance exams into medical college in India. While preparing for these exams, I got my first exposure to research through the Research Science Initiative in Chennai where I worked on a project regarding the use of nanogold in PCR with the Indian Institute of Technology and SASTRA University. 

Finally, in August 2012, after multiple rounds of exams and interviews, I joined St. John's Medical College to start my undergraduate studies to be a clinician.
